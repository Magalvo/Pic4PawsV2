# Work Track: Remake Foundation

## Goal

Create the Pic4Paws V2 architecture foundation before continuing implementation.

## Initial Milestones

1. Create and approve `docs/canonical/architecture-proposal.md`. Completed.
2. Create and approve `docs/canonical/sdd.md`. Completed.
3. Bootstrap or revise the codebase according to the approved architecture. Completed.
4. Define pet, shelter, adoption, sponsorship and payment database contracts. Completed through `DB-001`.
5. Rebuild features through strict TDD cycles. In progress.

## Completed Items (all merged to `main`)

Write path (Worker + client + Web/Mobile):
`AUTH-SUPABASE-001`, `SEC-001`, `WORKER-SUPABASE-WIRING-001`, `WORKER-SUPABASE-SDK-001`,
`R2-SIGNER-SDK-001`, `MEDIA-WORKER-PERSIST-001`,
`MEDIA-UPLOAD-CLIENT-001`, `MEDIA-UPLOAD-BINARY-CLIENT-001`, `MEDIA-UPLOAD-FLOW-CLIENT-001`,
`WEB-MEDIA-UPLOAD-001`, `MOBILE-MEDIA-UPLOAD-001`, `PET-MEDIA-UPLOAD-UI-001`,
`PET-MEDIA-ATTACH-WORKER-001`, `PET-MEDIA-ATTACH-CLIENT-001`, `PET-MEDIA-UPLOAD-ATTACH-FLOW-001`,
`WEB-PET-MEDIA-UPLOAD-ATTACH-001`, `MOBILE-PET-MEDIA-UPLOAD-ATTACH-001`,

`PET-DRAFT-SAVE-FLOW-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-PET-DRAFT-SAVE-FLOW-001`, `MOBILE-PET-DRAFT-SAVE-FLOW-001`.

Read path (Worker + client + Web/Mobile):
`PET-FEED-WORKER-001`, `PET-FEED-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-PET-FEED-001`, `MOBILE-PET-FEED-001`,
`PET-PROFILE-WORKER-001`, `PET-PROFILE-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-PET-PROFILE-001`, `MOBILE-PET-PROFILE-001`,
`SHELTER-PROFILE-WORKER-001`, `SHELTER-PROFILE-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-SHELTER-PROFILE-001`, `MOBILE-SHELTER-PROFILE-001`.

Adopter write path (Worker + client + Web/Mobile):
`ADOPTION-WORKER-001`, `ADOPTION-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-ADOPTION-001`, `MOBILE-ADOPTION-001`.

## Current Focus

All items above are merged. The adopter end-to-end adoption application flow is complete:
feed → pet profile → shelter profile → submit adoption application.

Recommended next slice — shelter-side adoption review (each on its own `agent/<WORK-ITEM-ID>` branch):

1. `ADOPTION-LIST-WORKER-001` — authenticated `GET /shelters/:shelterId/adoptions` Worker route
   (shelter members list pending applications for their shelter)
2. `ADOPTION-LIST-CLIENT-001` — `createAdoptionListClient` in `@pic4paws/client`
3. `WEB-ADOPTION-LIST-001` — Web adoption list product boundary
4. `MOBILE-ADOPTION-LIST-001` — Mobile adoption list product boundary

Alternatively, the donation/sponsorship slice can be pursued if the adoption review flow
is not a priority right now:

- `DONATION-WORKER-001` — `POST /donations` Worker route (payment initiation)
- `DONATION-CLIENT-001` — `createDonationClient` in `@pic4paws/client`
- `WEB-DONATION-001` / `MOBILE-DONATION-001` — Web/Mobile donation boundaries

The `donationTransactions` and `adoptionApplications` tables are already defined in
`packages/database/src/schema.ts`.

## Branching Convention

The default is **one branch per work item** (`agent/<WORK-ITEM-ID>`). See `AGENTS.md` §Git Workflow for the full rule and the narrow batch-branch exception.
