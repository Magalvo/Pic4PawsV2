# Work Track: Remake Foundation

## Goal

Create the Pic4Paws V2 architecture foundation before continuing implementation.

## Initial Milestones

1. Create and approve `docs/canonical/architecture-proposal.md`. Completed.
2. Create and approve `docs/canonical/sdd.md`. Completed.
3. Bootstrap or revise the codebase according to the approved architecture. Completed.
4. Define pet, shelter, adoption, sponsorship and payment database contracts. Completed through `DB-001`.
5. Rebuild features through strict TDD cycles. In progress.

## Completed Items (all merged to `main`)

Write path (Worker + client + Web/Mobile):
`AUTH-SUPABASE-001`, `SEC-001`, `WORKER-SUPABASE-WIRING-001`, `WORKER-SUPABASE-SDK-001`,
`R2-SIGNER-SDK-001`, `MEDIA-WORKER-PERSIST-001`,
`MEDIA-UPLOAD-CLIENT-001`, `MEDIA-UPLOAD-BINARY-CLIENT-001`, `MEDIA-UPLOAD-FLOW-CLIENT-001`,
`WEB-MEDIA-UPLOAD-001`, `MOBILE-MEDIA-UPLOAD-001`, `PET-MEDIA-UPLOAD-UI-001`,
`PET-MEDIA-ATTACH-WORKER-001`, `PET-MEDIA-ATTACH-CLIENT-001`, `PET-MEDIA-UPLOAD-ATTACH-FLOW-001`,
`WEB-PET-MEDIA-UPLOAD-ATTACH-001`, `MOBILE-PET-MEDIA-UPLOAD-ATTACH-001`,
`PET-PUBLISH-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-PET-PUBLISH-001`, `MOBILE-PET-PUBLISH-001`,
`PET-DRAFT-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-PET-DRAFT-001`, `MOBILE-PET-DRAFT-001`,
`PET-DRAFT-SAVE-FLOW-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-PET-DRAFT-SAVE-FLOW-001`, `MOBILE-PET-DRAFT-SAVE-FLOW-001`.

Read path (Worker + client + Web/Mobile):
`PET-FEED-WORKER-001`, `PET-FEED-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-PET-FEED-001`, `MOBILE-PET-FEED-001`,
`PET-PROFILE-WORKER-001`, `PET-PROFILE-CLIENT-001`, `WEB-PET-PROFILE-001`, `MOBILE-PET-PROFILE-001`.

## Current Focus

All items above are merged. The adopter discovery loop (feed → pet → shelter) is nearly
complete. Pet profiles expose `shelterId` but there is no public shelter profile route yet.

Recommended next items (each on its own `agent/<WORK-ITEM-ID>` branch):

1. `SHELTER-PROFILE-WORKER-001` — public `GET /shelters/:shelterId` route
2. `SHELTER-PROFILE-CLIENT-001` — `createShelterProfileClient` in `@pic4paws/client`
3. `WEB-SHELTER-PROFILE-001` — Web shelter profile product boundary
4. `MOBILE-SHELTER-PROFILE-001` — Mobile shelter profile product boundary

After the shelter profile slice, the next milestone is the adoption request flow.

## Branching Convention

The default is **one branch per work item** (`agent/<WORK-ITEM-ID>`). See `AGENTS.md` §Git Workflow for the full rule and the narrow batch-branch exception.
